# Air-Pollution-Analysis-during-lockdown-in-india
Main goal of the problem statement is to understand the impact of Air Pollution in our life. As we know that Air Pollution is very serious problem for the whole world and for India it is the major problem because most of cities in India are highly polluted. Here I will try to answer some questions about Vehicular and Industrial pollution during lockdown period in india and with the help of early senario I will try to explain the future effect on Vehicular and Industrial Pollution. To answer such questions I will be using the dataset called 'air-quality-data-in-india' from kaggle which has record from 2015 to 2020(till april) and for further interpretation I will be using another air quality dataset from kaggle which has record from 1992 to 2015.
